1. add(object)

    as we'll see later, to create groups of objects.

2. children 
    Returns a list of all the objects that have been added to the scene,
    including the camera and lights.

3. getChildByName(name)
    When you create an object, you can give it a distinct name
    by using the name attribute. The Scene object has a function
    that you can use to directly return an object with a specific
    name.

    remove it from the scene by using this function.

5. traverse(function)
    The children attribute returns a list of all the children in
    the scene. With the traverse() function we can also access
    these children by passing in a callback function.
